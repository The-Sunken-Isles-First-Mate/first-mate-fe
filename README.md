### Goals

Feature Delivery
- [ ] 90% or more MVP stories are completed
- [ ] at least 1 external API is consumed
- [ ] OAuth works error-free in incognito/private
- [ ] Students can explain in-depth what features use their chosen technologies, either FE or BE
- [ ] Project meets point threshold

Technical Quality
- [ ] Code follows DRY and SRP design
- [ ] Routes follow RESTful patterns (Frontend, User-facing routes are friendly)
- [ ] Controllers utilize Facades
- [ ] Facades utilize Service calls to store/retrieve data
- [ ] Deploy to the internet (using Render, Heroku, etc)
- [ ] No data storage (models, database schema, etc) is done at this layer; user info, sessions and caching are the exception
- [ ] Application is easy to navigate for non-technical users

Testing
- [ ] FE Repo - 90% or more test coverage, includes happy path and sad path expectations
- [ ] API calls to external services are tested using mocks/stubs in at least one application (using tools like Webmock, VCR, etc.)
